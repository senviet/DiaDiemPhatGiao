							<ul class="faq-list">
								<li class="q">How do you select members and tiers?</li>
								<li class="a">Launchpad selects technology-focused startups based on their ability to articulate their product idea. Successful applications can be at any stage, but must answer the question: what problem does your product solve? We then diversify across industry and geography. From this list, startups are selected into the "Start" or "Scale" tiers. Applicants can graduate from Start to Scale based on participation in our events and communities, nominations from other Googlers, and demonstrated traction (such as number of downloads or users).</li>
